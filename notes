one adjacency matrix  
just says how components are oriented and loops are formed
0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0


one resistive matrix of same order
but instead of 1's , values will be substituted

one voltage skew-matrix of same matrix
and values will be substituted
